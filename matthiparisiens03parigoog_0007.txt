The works to be published in octavo, separately, as

they were finished ; the whole responsibility of the tash
testing upon the editors, who were to be chosen by the
Master of the Rolls with the sanction of the Treusury.

The Lords ol Her Majesty’s lbeasruy, aiter a carcful
consideration of the subject, expressed their opinion in a
Treasury Minute, dated February 9, 1857, that the plan
rocommended hythe Master ol the Rolls “was well
calculated for the accomplishment of this important
national object, in an effectual and satisfactory manner,
within a reasonable time, and provided proper attention
be paid to economy, in making the detailed arrange·
ments, without unnecessary expense.’'

They expressed their approbationes the proposel that
each Chronicle and historical document should be edited
in such a manner as to represent with all possible cor-
rectness the text of each writer, derived from acollation
of the best MSS, and that no notes should be added,
except such as were illustrative of the various readings.
They suggested, however, that the preface to each work
should contum, in addition to the particulars proposed
hythe Master cf the Ralla a biographical account of
the author, so far as authentia materiale existed for that
purpose, and an estimate of his historical credibility and
velue.
