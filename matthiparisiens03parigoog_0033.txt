There is, probably, no other instance on re'cord of an'

melliora} The Historia Aaploawm was intended, as stated by
&¹¹³¹sp the author, to illustrate chiefly the state of English
affairs¹ from the period of the Oonquest ;2 and in
abridging the larger work he omits nearly everything
relating to foreign eventa (with the exception of the
Orusade, for which he specially pleads⁸), aa also the reli-
gious legende given byWendover, and various letters and
lengthy documenta. But although the Chronico Maiora
are more diffuso, the HiatocturAragloruam, on the other
hand, abounds more in· details, and adds a large amount
of persona] anecdota, as well as many minute facts and
circumstances, which would be sought for invain else-
where, and which throw so much light on contemporary
usages and the state of society. In this respect there is a

great resemblance between Matthew Paris and Ordericus -

vitalis* who wrote a century earlier. Both were
monks of the same Order3 their studies and discipline
werealika, withthe sarnetum ofmind3 both were dili-
gent collectore of information ; both were fond of gossip
and the marvellous, particularly when brought hum

distant countries; and both were special retailers of anec-
dote, which occasionally might be liable to the charge
of exaggeration

Authoritie· The authorities followed by Matthew Paris, exclusive

fflppaeuy ol Wendover, are chiefly the same as those of his

Paris.
