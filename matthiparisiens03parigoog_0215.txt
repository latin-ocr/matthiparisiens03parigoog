London in Feb. 1614, as “brevem Historiam ejusdem
Matthaei [Parisicnsis], ubi acrius invehitur in Roma·

’ num tyrannidem.''1 Later still (111 1657), some extracta

were made from the work by Sir James Warc (MS.
Add. 4783, fol. 97), who errs with J oscelin in giving
it the title of “ Ager Sterilis ;” 0111 at the close of
the 17th century Dr. Thomas Gale had consulted it,
as appears by the following note in his handwriting
in the manuscript (fol 916); “ Η10 desinit Matth.
Paris Historia Mereor, quse est epitome Majoris, quae
ad 1258 [1259] continuatur.'' Two faults are here ap·
parent, first in calling this work the Historia Mc'rwr
(and thus confounding it with the Histortc Araplo-
rom), and then in stating it to be a compendium of the
Greater Ohronicle, which it certainly is not. Το these
scanty notices 01 the work may he added the brief men·
tion made of it in a note to the second edition 01 Oave's
“Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Historia Literaria,'’ vol. ii.
p. 298, published in 1713,2 whence, no doubt, Tanner
derived the meagre reference made to the Cotton manu-
script 111 his Bibliotheca, p. 752. Since his time the
work appears to have been almost wholly ignored ; and

among recent historicel writers, Mrs. Everett Green is ’
the only one who has occasionally availed herself of
the information it contains.³ She quotes it, however,
either as the work 01 011 anonymous historiam or as

the chronicle 01 Rishanger, which, 01 course, is an over-
sight
