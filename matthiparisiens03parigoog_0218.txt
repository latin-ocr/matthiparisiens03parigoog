111111, but with numerous alterations and insertione.
Sume of these are taken from the Hieronica Moy'oru
(references to which, under various titles, are frequently
made), but the majority contain new and interesting
matter, or give us the opinions 01 the writer in regard
10 the conduct 01 the Sovereign and the affairs 01 the

Roman Court, which it is useiul and instructius to
compare with those expressed in his other writings. In
the last two years, 1254 and 1255,1110 Greater Chronicle
10 closely followed.

Although certainly in the handwriting 01 1101111011
Ρο110, the text exhibita numerous instantes 01 care-
lessness (as pointed out in the scot-notes), and has
never received the authors customary and final revision.
Instances 01 verbal inaccuracies, 011110010110, and repeti-
tions occur throughout, oi which it is sufficient here
to refer 1ο those which occur under the years 1053‚1098‚
1123, 1125, 1112, and 1201. These 011010, however,
‹lo not at all detract from the historica} value 01 the
work, 01110111 thc confidence we should place in 1110
general good saith and aceuracy 01 the historiari.

In printing the text 01 this Chronicle‚ it hasbeen
judged advisable to omit such passages as are verbally
the same with the Historia Asplorum, and their
absence is indicated by dots. References are also added

· in the margin to the printed peges 01 the latter work, in

which 1110 omitted portions occur.

It is also desirable to point out (with greater precision
than was indicated in the Preface 101011 p. xxiii.
note ¹), that the text of the present work has been ver·

bally copied into the original MS. 01 1110 Flora Histo-
maram, falsely attributed 10 “ Matthew 01 Westmin·

. ster,’' from the words “Comes Ricardus cum maxima

gloria,” in 1250 (101 iii. p. 311), 10 the end 011110 year
1255.
