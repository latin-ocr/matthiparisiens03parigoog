Mmiflee- These passages form so prominent a feature in the

{⁰¹¹⁰fhi' Chronico Moy'oou, that some powerful motive must

law have influenced Matthew Paris to modify and seltener
{mm omit some of them in the Historia duplorum. The
erasures and alterations in the text of the latter work¹
would seem to have been made after the year 1252, and
the evident object in altering the text was to avoid
giving personal offenoe to the king. It seems very
probable that Henry’s friendly and condescending notice
of the historisn, combined with the liberality shown by
him in gifts to the abbey of St. Alban’s, might have
caused Paris 1ο judge him less unfavourably3 added to
which, it seems a reasonable conjecture that Paris
intended to present his work to the king, or cause a copy
cf it to be made for him. This would sufficiently account
for the removal of expressions that might properly bs
judged offendiculo in the copy intended for the king’s
perusal. It would appear also, thetae the text of the
Majoou Chronico was lelt untouched, the alterations
made in the Historia duplorum will account for the
suppression of all references in it to the former work,
which are in nearly every instance erased, and others
substituted, some of which are extremely vagus.

Thus, several passages and sentences reflecting cn the

md, or tymnny and duplicity of the king’s father, John, are
omitted erased or marked for omission,8 and with the same
