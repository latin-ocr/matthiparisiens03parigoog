This is badly engraved by Gough in 111οΒ111101 Topo-
prophy, 1780, vol i, pl. iv„ and described with many
blandem, pp. 68-71. He speaks of it as “ the completest

by Matthew Paris from the shorter history of Diceto.2

based on Wendover, but much abbreviated, with oddi-

been undoubtedly abridged from the Historia Araplo-
