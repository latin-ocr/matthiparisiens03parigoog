Oa the aeth of Ianuary 1857, the Master of the Rolls
submitted to the Treasury a preposal for the publication
of materials for the History of this Oountry from the
Invasion of the Romans tc the Reign ef Henry VIII.

'l'he Master of the Rolls suggested that these materials
should be selected fer publication under competent
editors without reference to periodieal or chronological
arrangement, without mutilation or abridgment, prefer-
ence being given, in the first instance, to such materiale
as were mest searce and valuable.

He proposed that each chroniele or historical docu-
ment to be edited should be treated in the same way as
if the editor were engaged on an Editio Princeps3 and
for this purpose the mest correct text should be formed
from an accurate collation of the best MSS.

'lb render the work more generally useful, the Master
of the Rolls suggested that the editor should gire an
account of the MSS. employed by him, of their age and
their peculiarities3 that he should add to the work a
brief account of the life and times of the author, and any
remarks necessary to explain the chronology3 but no
other note or comment was to be allowed, except what
might be necessary to establish the correctness of the

text.
