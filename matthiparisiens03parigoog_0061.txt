gave the above statement, but it is certain it could not
have been from mere conjecture. Granting that Paris
was the author of this poem, there would bs no difficulty
in attributing also to him the satirical French song on
the oppressed state of the church, written at St. Alban's
in 1256, and inserted at the end of Wallinglord’s Chro-
nicles.¹ Hence, Pits might perhaps be justified in
speaking of Paris as a poet, but when he goes on to
characterise him aa an orator, a logician, a philosopher, a
mathematician‚ and a theologian‚ hs seems to draw
lurgely on his imagination.²

Concluion· Here these observatione must close, although much
more might be said to do full justice to the historian os
St Alban's. With ons exception, all the modern English
historical writers⁸ have been unanimous in their praise
of Mattheus Puris. It is certain, that for a large portion
of the reign of Henry the Third hs is almost the sole
authority, and on this account is fully intitled to the
gratitudo of posterity.
