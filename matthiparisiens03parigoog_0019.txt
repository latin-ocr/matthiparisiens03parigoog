return from nominey, from the information giren to hirn
by Geoffrey lincheon, the abhat’ s rneaeenger.² Agmin,
under1195,in referende to the Apologneof Vrtalis the
Venetian, related by Richard⁸ he makoe the following
note, “Apologus Rioardi regis, qnam ahhuti Sancti Al-
bani Gnarino, et ipse nobie enarras-{w In 'the first ot*
these instanees Paris probably heard the story from
Besaoe many years after the erent,⁸ and thia may hare
been the ease also with Geoffrey Hsekesalt, bnt with
regard to king Richard's Apologue, if we are to in·
terpret the worda literally, Paris must have heard it
before the death of abbat warin, which took place in
April 1195.ο This would throw bach the birth of
Matthew Poris at leest to the year 1185, and make him
seventy-soorat his death in 1259-novery extraordinary
age-hut the difficulty of reoonciling thia with the date
os his taking the monastic habit in 1217 is so great, that
it will be preferable to understand the words “ nobis
enerravit” as applying to the monks of the abhey in
general, or else as writing in the name os Wendover, to
Probeole whose text the whole story ia an addit-ion. On the
fflossffi‘ whole, therefore, it will be safer to fix the birth of our
umber historiar about the year 1200, or a few years earlier,
Μ’· and this will make him upwards of sixty at hia desesiae,
which ia well borne out by the appearance of hia por·
