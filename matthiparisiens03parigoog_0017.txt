Agentes· place‚¹ that abbat Warin 01 St. Alban's (al). 1183-
ξξέξζᾶξῖι 1195) had made a regidation that when a novice received
the tonsure he should at the sometime assume the
monastic habit, and not defer doing eo till his profession
was made; and this rulo, in all probability, remained in
force. The age of a novice, 00 admissi0n‚ seems to have
varied in different monasteries. At the Benediotine
monastery of St Augustine's, Oanterbury, the monks ob-
tained a papal bull in 1180, not to admit under the age
of fifteen? and this may have been ,in general the prac-
tice at St. Alban’a, until by the revision 01 the statutes
01 the Benediotine Order in 1238 (by pope Gregory ΙΧ.),
the age 01 probation was lixed at nineteen, and os pro·
fession at twenty years 01 age.³ Under the rule 01
abbat Robert (in 1158), a scholar 01 Montreuil “ aetate
juvenia,’' took the habit (10511000 rctipioaic acccepit),
at St. Alban's, and remained three years afterwards “in
disciplina novitiali ; ”⁴ but a subseqnent abbat, John de
Cella (nl). 1195-1211), 00 being applied tc by one 01
the monlrs to admit his nephew, then a bcy at school,
refused to do so, “quia impubes erat, nec adhuc tantae
Hnnoaee aetatis ut esset idoneus.’'⁵ If Matthew Paris was
ofprenous received as a novica in 1217 (as appears probable), it is
