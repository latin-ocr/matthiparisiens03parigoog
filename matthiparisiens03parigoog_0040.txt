Henry are similarly treated, or are rra-written in a
milder tone.¹ Some passages also directed against earl
Richard, the king's brother, are erased 3² and others con-
demning in strong terme the conduct of archbishop
Bonisana of Savoy, the queen's uncle, are erased and
re·written.⁸ The exactione of* the papal court and
rapacity of the legates and nuncios are frequently modi-
fied or marked for omission, no doubt on account of the
censuras passed on them, and reflecting on the king, for
permitting or sharing in the spoil⁴ The passage relative
to the burning of the pope’s chamber at Lyons in 1245,
ascribed by his enemies to himself as a pretence for ex·
acting money, is replaced by another, in which the blame
is laid on the agents of the emperor.5 Some passages
also hostile to the mendicant Orders are re-written.⁰
This change of sentiment seems to bave been brought
about in consequence of certain Minorites, agents of the
pope, having offered to protect the exempt monasterias
(among which St. Alban’s was one of the chief) against
the encroachment of episcopal authority, and heneefortb
these Orders were regarded aa friends instead of rivale.
